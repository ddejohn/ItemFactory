# ItemFactory

*A random weapon and armor generator which provides richly detailed descriptions, unique names, and basic item stats*

**ItemFactory** generates items loosely based on the names and constituent pieces of common medieval weapons and armor. There are more than 10^24^ possible combinations of items alone, not counting the possible names and descriptions!
